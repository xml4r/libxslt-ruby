== 0.8.2 / 2008-07-21 Charlie Savage

* To use LibXSLT you can either require 'xslt' or require 'libxslt'.
  The differences is that require 'xslt' mixes the LibXML and
  LIBXSLT modules into the global namespace, thereby allowing
  you to write code such as:
    stylesheet = XSLT::Stylesheet.new(XML::Document.new).  Note that
  this is different from 0.8.0 release and may require updating your code.

* Support for libxml-ruby 0.8.2

* Improved Windows support - libxslt-ruby should now work out of the box.

* Updated RDocs.


== 0.6.0 / 2008-07-01 Charlie Savage
